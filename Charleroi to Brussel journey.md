Traveling from Charleroi Airport to Brussels
==============
there are three options to get from Charleroi (Brussels-south) airport to the centre of brussels.  You can also find some basic information on the [website of the airport](https://www.brussels-charleroi-airport.com/en/parking-access)
1. Public transport (cheapest but longest journey)
2. Private bus/shuttle service (faster journey but a bit more expensive)
3. Taxi service (expensive) 
# 1. Public transport* 
**(1 hour and 20 min | +26y: 15.10 EUR/person / -26y: 13.70 EUR/person)**
1. First you need to download some apps and make some accounts to buy your tickets. I would do this before your flight if you are going for this option.

*\*\*This app you will definitely use in the future*

# 2. Flibco shuttle service
**(1 hour | <20.00 EUR/person)**

I think this is my preferred method to go to Brussels. It is convenient, fast and reliable. I must admit I have never used this service, because it is not a good choice to go where I live.  But you leave the airport and all these shuttlebuses are parked in front of the exit. 
1. Buy tickets via the [website](https://www.flibco.com/en) or at the [physical shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/onHBFxLdHzMcFZqk8)
2. Done
# 3. Taxi
**(120.00 EUR/car)**

Bolt exists in Belgium but only in Brussels and Flanders. Uber is an option for about 120.00 EUR. I have no clue what the prices are for other "offline" taxi services. but on the website of the airport I linked earlier there is some contact info of different taxi companies. 

I only see people use taxi services in Belgium in the more rural parts and often for going to restaurants and such. In between cities the trains are easy and relatively affordable and in the cities public transport like tram, bus, metro are the way to go. (or rental bikes) 

# 4. Planning a journey
I use the apps for buying tickets and maybe checking specific trains or busses (there are some live tracking features) and I use Google maps to plan my journeys. 

1. **Busses, trams, metro in Belgium**
	1. [TEC](https://www.letec.be/View/Lapplication_TEC/1003):  in Wallonia (Cities like: Charleroi, Mons, Dinant)
	2. [De Lijn](https://www.delijn.be/en/content/ontdek-de-app/) in Flanders (Cities like: Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp)
	3. [STIB/MIVB](https://www.stib-mivb.be/buy/get-moving-with-the-stib-mivb-app) in Brussels
2. [SNCB/NMBS](https://www.belgiantrain.be/EN/travel-info/prepare-for-your-journey/use-the-sncb-app): trains in Belgium
